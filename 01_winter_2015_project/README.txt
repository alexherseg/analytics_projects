Motivation:
This report seeks to identify and quantify relationships between three community indicators; is there a relationship between the characteristics of vacant/abandoned properties with the types of businesses in the city and, is there an association between the types of businesses in an area with the types of crime that occur in that area?

Files:
chicago_crime_project.pdf - contains the final project report
cca_code.R - contains the R code of CCA
data directory - contains the crime, business, and abandoned housing datasets

Notes:
I only have the access to the clean data. The original raw data was probably too large for me to want to keep around (Plus, I could re-download it from the City of Chicago data portal).

Motivation:
During the course we implemented our own hadoop cluster on amazon's EC2. For my course project, I evaluated different configurations of Hadoop (single vs. three workers vs. a traditional relational database implementation) on different sized datasets.  On the Hadoop configurations I also compared the performance of Hive against Pig.

Notes
I ended up using the same films database from the other projects. I didn't want to but taking 3 courses instead of 2 (2 is considered full time) left me with little time to find another suitable dataset.

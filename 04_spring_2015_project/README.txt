Motivation:
Using horror films reviews data, we wanted to identify relationships between users; what are the similarities between users? Do natural communities arise in the social network? If so, who are the important nodes in the network? And can we use the network to predict which users will review the same movie next?

Files:
horror_films_sna.docx - contains the social network analysis report
project_submission - subdirectory which contains all of the files used in the analysis. The html and Rmd files are the main files in this folder. The Rmd file can be used to recreate the analysis, and the HTML contains all output of our analysis. All other files are helper files.

Notes
We ended up using the film reviews from the movieLens dataset. The dataset should not be difficult to find with an internet search.
